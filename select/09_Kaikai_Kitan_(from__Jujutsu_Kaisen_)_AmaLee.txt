Revealing their true hidden colors, the masses form like an army of vengeful wights
Some hearts are kind, foolishly living life
Different names but the same vain, worthless people
Life’s so unfair
Expectations everywhere
But out of reach
‘Cause life taunts the talentless
Treat equally, both friend and enemy
I truly believe that there is no place for me
I wanna cry in the gaps of my dreams
I’m holding out for answer please,
Won’t someone ever reply to me? ‘Cause
I don’t know what to believe
We’ll light up the darkness - We’ll light up the darkness
The curtain of night will lift, blessing us with a sign
Face me and admit - This loop is infinite
This isn’t the time for us to give life to lies
Don’t ever hold me back - Don’t ever hold me back
My soul it was born for more than anybody else in this city,
Was capable of more than just existing
But now I can’t imagine there’s a future for a cursed man like me
Fell again but I intend to fight through all the pain til the end
The world’s been waiting for this one moment
Ah, it feels so right to reclaim though we break all the rules
For the future we’ve wrongly obeyed
Everything’s so wrong, I need just a piece of some normality
Can’t speak - can’t scream - The chaos is making me weak
This abyss has got me tied up like a puppet in strings
Heaven, Hell, it’s tempting - promise me
That you will never throw away your life
Against these hollow promises you’ll shine
Won’t someone ever reply to me - I’m crying please
Cause I’m still lost and - I don’t know what to believe
Live true to virtue - Live true to virtue
My thoughts connecting with a crowd of uncertain sounds
Reach for me a bit, this loop is infinite
I hold out my hand - to grasp what lies beyond
I gotta pursue it - I gotta pursue it
I wanna be stronger, more than anybody else ‘cause that I know that
Destiny will try to me under
And I’m already falling deeper, sinking to the depths of darkest black
How do I Iook on the outside?
This is who I have become, I -
I wanna laugh but nothing’s left - I feel like I’m a body rotting, useless
I’ve decided I won’t run away from all of the problems in my way
The vision my mind’s created ‘s imaginary - I wonder what lies beyond?
We’ll light up the darkness - We’ll light up the darkness
The curtain of night will lift, blessing us with a sign
Face me and admit - This loop is infinite
This isn’t the time for us to give life to lies
Can’t ever hold me back - Can’t ever hold me back
My soul it was born for more than anybody else in this city,
Was capable of more than just existing
But now I can’t imagine there’s a future for a cursed man like me
Fell again but I intend to fight through all the pain til the end
The world’s been waiting for this one moment
